		<p><i>Heart of the City</i> is part picture, part story, and part outreach on behalf of musicians, music industry professionals, and their family members who are hard at work making a living and make art in the changing dynamics of our growing city. This project is an artistic collaboration between the SIMS Foundation, photographer Carlos J. Matos, and Ovrld Magazine.</p>
