			<h1 class="portrait-title">Miss Lavelle White</h1>
			<p><span id="bold">Morgan Davis for Ovrld: I wanted to start by talking to you about your life in Austin, and your life in general. You’ve had a long, incredible career.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">Miss LaVelle White:</span> Why yes, I have, I’m thankful and blessed.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You originally came from Louisiana, right?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Well, I was born in Jackson, Mississippi but I grew up in both places, Louisiana and Jackson. My mother was a sharecropper, so was my dad, so was everybody. So I know what the hard roads are. I know how life is. I know everything is not easy. But you see, life is like this: it’s what you make of it. So you’ve got to hang in there. That’s what I’ve been doing. And I’m hoping the rope don’t break [laughs].</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: A lot of your music talks about that hardship and the journeys you’ve taken…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> It hasn’t been easy.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: From what I understand, until about 1994 you had mostly recorded singles, specifically doing a lot of work for the Duke label. I’m curious about how you got to be on Don Robey’s label.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> This is how I got there. I was singing with Johnny Copeland’s band and I wrote this song [sings] “If, if, if/I could be with you…” And when I wrote that he said “You know, that’s a pretty good song. Why don’t you show Don Robey this song?” So he took me down there and he liked this song and I had like four or five other songs. And they recorded it and that’s how it got picked up the Duke label.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You wrote for Bobby Bland as well, right?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Mmm hmm. I did that song “Lead Me On,” do you like that song?</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I do, I love that song. And I was listening to your version earlier today. It’s fantastic. It’s a great track.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> It was written by my mom.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Oh really? Was it something she would sing to you when you were growing up?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes. And it was like when she passed, it really hurt. I was singing to what happened to her and me back then. That’s what I was thinking about. That’s why I sing “Lead me on/Take my hand/Here’s my hand/Lead me on/You don’t know how it feels to be a stranger/In this unfriendly land,” I was talking to her.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: So it’s a song about guidance?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Right. I wanted her to guide me.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I read that when you originally wrote that for Bobby Bland, it was credited to Don Robey under a pseudonym…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes. It was credited to him, but it’s mine.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Was that just common practice at that time?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes. Also I wrote one for my friend here, in Austin, and she’s recorded it. You know Marcia Ball?</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Yes.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Well, I wrote something for her.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Which song did you write for her?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I can’t remember its name right now, but I really like her cadence. I like when other artists want me to write for them. It’s like life is so fast, you know? Life is so fast for me right now. Sometimes I can’t even think. It’s a busy time for me right now. And it’s a pleasure, I’m having a good time.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Yeah, I can imagine! You just celebrated your 87th birthday, over at Antone’s…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, it was a great time.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I heard it was fantastic! I missed it but everyone was talking about it…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> It was beautiful. I wish you could have been there.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I do too, but I was out of town when it happened.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I want to do a show for you guys, I gotta get you out to take some pictures of my shows and stuff. You can come and do some videos.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Definitely! That reminds me, when I was looking through your recordings, I noticed that there are a ton of videos of your performances, from all kinds of different eras, but most are from Antone’s and Continental Club here in Austin. I know in the ‘70s, though, you had moved to Chicago and became part of that great Chicago scene.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I had some great times. I was there for nine years.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: And then you came to Houston and it was in Houston that you had a new renaissance.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, yes. I made it my home.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: What brought you to Houston from Chicago?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Well, what brought me to Houston from Chicago was my brother. My brother was living there then, I came to live with family because they needed me there. Back when we lived there as kids, I used to sneak out of the windows at night and go to the clubs [laughs]. I wasn’t but 15 or 16 then.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: So you had a lot of good memories of Houston?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh yeah, a lot of good memories. We used to play in this club called Menutis', it was really cool, you know? But we didn’t make a whole lot of money [laughs]. Maybe $25 and drinks.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Well, unfortunately I can’t say payout has changed much today.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> No, it hasn’t [laughs].</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: That’s one of the less glamorous facts of the music industry. Houston has a great tradition of R&B and soul, though.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Well, right now they do, but back then they were too much into country.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Right, and when you returned in 1994, it was more on the blues side.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, it was more blues. I wrote this song then…[kid laughs in the background] Ain’t she the cutest? I love kids. I was one once. But anyway, like I was saying earlier, “Gonna Make It” is the song I wrote for Marcia Ball.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: That’s great. The other thing that was interesting to me was that it wasn't until you were back in Houston in the ‘90s that you recorded your first full length album, though you had been performing for close to 40 years by that point.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, that was the first time I really got a break.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: And that was on Antone’s label. Not long after that, you relocated to Austin, what prompted that?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Well, what shifted it was Clifford Antone. He set up his club and so I came here and I sang at his club for two years.</p> 


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: And that won you over to the city?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yeah, it was a music city.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You seemed to get a lot more recognition when you came here. You got elected to the Texas Music Hall of Fame around then. The city seems especially drawn to the history you have.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, it is drawn to my history, my connection to the music.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You’ve performed with some truly incredible people over the years…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh, yes, like the Isley Brothers, James Brown…</p>
			

			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Otis Redding…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, I actually accepted his award [The Otis Redding Award] in France.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Do you have any particular memories of playing with artists like that that stand out as exceptional stories or experiences?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh yes, oh yes. I’ve had a beautiful life. I was with The Drifters, we’d get up and play and BB [King] would play behind me… BB taught me how to dress [laughs]. He went shopping me and we’d pick out stuff. I was with some amazing people. It was astounding. Beautiful. I loved it.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: On the dressing up front, you’re known for always putting on an incredible show and always showing up looking your best…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yeah, I always try to wear something that’s pleasing to the public. I see some people who perform, they try to be like me…</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: But there’s only one Miss LaVelle White…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Exactly! It makes me feel good to dress beautifully.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: It seems like that really clicks with a lot of people, too. People are always blown away by what a great style you have.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I developed my own style. I didn’t take my style from anyone else. I didn’t even take a voice lesson. I didn’t do any of that. I looked to God to teach me everything I know and he did. And He still is teaching me.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Something that I love about your style is how you built it by integrating a lot of different soul and R&B and blues styles. Like how you work in a lot of Louisiana R&B… ”Voodoo Man” is a great track with that.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh yes, that’s Louisiana there!</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Do you think that by performing as long as you have, that’s allowed you to develop even more unique styles? Because you’ve got the experience and can combine things that people without that background wouldn’t know how to?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, I enjoy it, and I think the audience does. My fans all do. I want to please them. I love my fans. I’ve got some loving fans. They come out to me in spite of rain or whatever, they’re always there. I want them to know I love them so much, and I appreciate them. And I’m gonna keep on doing it, baby.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: What are some things that you’ve seen that have changed in the scene recently? What are some new challenges or obstacles that you didn’t face back in the day?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> There are a lot of new challenges that I didn’t know were gonna come. But I change with ‘em.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You feel like you’ve got to adapt and evolve.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yeah, you’ve gotta adapt.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovlrd: You’ve been good about doing work to get your music out onto new platforms. Like you’ve got all of your albums up on Bandcamp so that people can stream it now. Are you getting even more fans now in the internet era?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh yes, oh yes, a lot of new fans. And I’m attracting some young people. People in their teens and twenties come into the club. And I talk to them, and mess with them. They just love that, you know? And I’m teaching people about music they didn’t know about before. They say that, they tell me “Hey, I wanna be like you,” and I say “Well, go right on ahead, be like me, I don’t care, it makes me feel good.” [laughs]</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You’ve also been performing a lot of festivals lately.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Oh yeah, I always like playing them.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: What do you think about some of the newer artists doing similar soul styles to what you were doing early on, like Sharon Jones?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I think they’re great. They do it in their own way and this is what matters. They don’t try to sound like me, they’re doing their own thing and I think that’s great.</p> 


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Are there any new artists that stand out to you as especially interesting or inspirational?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I loved Whitney Houston, and I like things like that. I can’t think of names right now because I’m all excited. But there are a lot of artists I like to listen to. I like to listen to music like dance music. I can feel it in my soul. And hip hop.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I actually heard that you’ve got a claim to being one of the pioneers of rap.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yeah, I do that! A lot of the artists would ask me “How do you do that? How do you rap?” I don’t know, I just do it.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: What are you working on now?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I’m working on some reggae music. I got a song about loving the world. I got some songs about what’s going on. I’ve even got one about ISIS! But I’m afraid to read the lyrics [laughs].</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You’ve got to be careful on that subject, don’t you?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes you do!</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Who are some of the reggae artists that influenced you?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I love Bob Marley, and his sons… Ziggy and there’s another one…</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Damian?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes! Him! I love him! I love some of the girls too. I think reggae is going to take over.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: It has been having a major resurgence lately…</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Hasn’t it? I love it. I got one song that I wrote and it says “God, give us love/Like he spread it/This love from above/One nation under God/Under which they say it stands/And we should love all our fellow man/Stop the killing/Stop the hate/Get together, we can’t wait/It’s been so long/It’s been going on/We gotta stop it now/Before it gets any further.” We’re not loving each other like we should be. We should love each other right, and from the heart, that’s the way it should be. That’s what I’m working on with my band.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I’m excited to hear that. There’s a lot of talk about love and unity in your music in general.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yes, there is. And a lot about shaking your booty too! [laughs]</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: That is equally important!</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I have one, “Take Your Drawers Off,” “Take your drawers off/And lay them on the table/Everyone in the club if you are able/Take your drawers/And lay them on the floor/And if your drawers aren’t clean/Take them home and put ‘em in the washing machine.” Everybody likes that song.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: I can see why.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> It is crazy.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: For people who are moving to Austin to have a career in music now, what are some of the lessons you would impart on them?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I try to put the lesson on them that all music is good. That you can’t just love one type of music. I don’t love one type of music. I love all types of music.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Yeah, you have to keep an open mind.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Right! They got some people who only want to do country, they don’t want to hear that black people music. I try to tell everyone, why be that way? It’s just one of those things that we have to deal with. Because they don’t like us black people. They want us black people out of the way, you know that.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: There are a lot of artists in Austin who have been trying to combat that and speak up, a lot of other acts have talked to me about that feeling.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Yeah, like Gary Clark Jr. and myself and a lot of the rappers on the East Side. We go and talk to our people and share names. We try to get others to see that hatred is not the solution.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Right, and music is all about connecting and making people cross boundaries anyway.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> Right, right.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: Would you say Austin audiences have been more accepting than other cities you’ve been in?</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I think so, some of them. Most cities I’ve been to have accepted me. They treat me real good. But Austin is different. In Austin, they come out to see you. Every time you play. Every time I play someone is there. And that’s what has made me love them. I think they’re more receptive to me than when I was younger.</p>


			<p><span id="bold">Ovrld: You don’t have to prove yourself as much.</span></p>


			<p><span id="bold">MLW:</span> I don’t have to work as hard! [laughs]
