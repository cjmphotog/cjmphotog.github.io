			<h2>About Heart of the City</h2>
			<p>Heart of the city was conceived by photographer Carlos J. Matos in partnership with Ovrld, the SIMS Foundation, and the city's Cultural Arts Division as a way to honor the people who make Austin's music industry what it is, and a vehicle for bringing attention to the various challenges affecting their ability to work and make music in our city.</p>
			<p>The project takes a multimedia approach to storytelling by combining portraiture, written interviews, and film into a single narrative. The stories center around twelve individuals from the heart of Austin's music ecosystem, from performers to stage managers and everything in between, all set within some of Austin's most iconic and culture-defining venues.</p>
